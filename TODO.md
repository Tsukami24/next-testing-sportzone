# Frontend COD Payment Integration - Task Progress

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Frontend Checkout Page Updates
- **File**: `src/app/checkout/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added COD payment creation logic after order submission
  - Calls `createPembayaran` API with COD method when COD is selected
  - Proper error handling for COD payment creation failures
  - Maintains order creation even if COD payment creation fails

### 2. Admin COD Payment Management Page
- **File**: `src/app/pembayaran/page.tsx` (new)
- **Features**:
  - Displays all COD payments that need manual confirmation
  - Allows admins to update payment status (BELUM_BAYAR â†’ SUDAH_BAYAR or GAGAL)
  - Automatic order status updates when COD payment is confirmed
  - Stock reduction for confirmed COD payments
  - Visual status indicators and loading states
  - Error handling and success messages

### 3. Service Functions Verification
- **Verified**: `updatePaymentStatus` function exists in `src/app/services/pembayaran.ts`
- **Verified**: `getAllPesanan` function exists in `src/app/services/pesanan.ts`
- **Verified**: `createPembayaran` function exists for COD payment creation

## ðŸ”„ Integration Flow

### COD Payment Flow:
1. **User Checkout**: User selects COD payment method in checkout
2. **Order Creation**: Order is created with COD payment method
3. **Payment Record**: Frontend calls `createPembayaran` API to create COD payment record
4. **Admin Confirmation**: Admin can view and update COD payment status via `/pembayaran` page
5. **Order Processing**: When admin confirms payment, order status updates to "DIPROSES" and stock is reduced

### Backend Integration:
- Backend `PembayaranService.createCodPayment()` creates payment record with status BELUM_BAYAR
- Backend `PembayaranService.updatePembayaranStatus()` handles COD payment status updates
- Automatic stock reduction and order status updates for confirmed COD payments

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test COD payment creation during checkout
- [ ] Verify payment record is saved in database
- [ ] Test admin COD payment management page
- [ ] Verify order status updates when COD payment is confirmed

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation** by creating orders with COD payment
2. **Verify database records** are created properly
3. **Test admin functionality** for updating COD payment statuses
4. **Monitor order processing** and stock management
5. **Handle edge cases** like failed payment creation
